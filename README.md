# README

E-commerce site. Uses `bcrypt` and `materialize`. There's a seed file. Set up your own admin. If you have questions, I'll be in Bali with no email. Ask someone else.

To set up:

* `rake db:setup`

* Sorry, didn't get around to tests. It mostly works. There might be a few bugs.


Ensure that users can't order a negative number of items.
Add flash messages for signing up, signing in and signing out.
Add product validations.
Add password validations to ensure a user's password is sufficiently complex.
Fix the row height for products, which can quickly become uneven.
Add product update and delete functionality for admins.
Add admin flash messages for adding, updating and deleting products.
Add admin links to navbar so admins can easily add, update and delete products.
